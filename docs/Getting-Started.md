# Getting Started

This page takes you from an empty SD card to a working openwifi access point that your phone or laptop can join. Budget about an hour the first time.

## 1. What you need

**Hardware**

- A supported SDR board (see table below).
- An SD card that is 16 GB or larger.
- Two antennas suitable for 2.4/5 GHz (or SMA cables + at least 30 dB attenuation for conducted tests).
- An Ethernet cable between the board and your PC.
- Optionally a USB-UART cable for a serial console, which helps a lot when networking doesn't come up.

**Supported boards.** The most common ones are below. The full matrix, per-board hardware notes, and the GPIO/LED debug map are on the [Supported Boards](Supported-Boards.md) page.

| `board_name` | Hardware | Vivado license needed to rebuild FPGA? |
|---|---|---|
| `zc706_fmcs2` | Xilinx ZC706 + AD-FMCOMMS2/3/4 | Yes |
| `zed_fmcs2` | Avnet/Digilent ZedBoard + AD-FMCOMMS2/3/4 | No |
| `zc702_fmcs2` | Xilinx ZC702 + AD-FMCOMMS2/3/4 | No |
| `zcu102_fmcs2` | Xilinx ZCU102 (MPSoC, 64-bit) + AD-FMCOMMS2/3/4 | Yes |
| `adrv9364z7020` | ADRV9364-Z7020 SoM + ADRV1CRR-BOB carrier | No |
| `adrv9361z7035` | ADRV9361-Z7035 SoM + ADRV1CRR-BOB/FMC carrier | Yes |
| `antsdr`, `e310v2`, `antsdr_e200` | MicroPhase enhanced ADALM-Pluto family | No |
| `sdrpi` | HexSDR Raspberry-Pi-sized SDR | No |
| `neptunesdr`, `LibreSDR` | Low-cost Zynq-7020 + AD9361 boards (community-supported, unofficial) | No |

!!! info "The `board_name` string matters"
    It selects which FPGA image and boot files you use throughout the project (the same string names the board in all the [repos](Repositories.md)). The "Vivado license" column above only matters if you rebuild the FPGA yourself. The prebuilt image works regardless.

!!! tip "No hardware?"
    If you have no board at all, the imec **[w-iLab.t testbed](https://doc.ilabt.imec.be/ilabt/wilab/tutorials/openwifi.html)** offers remote access to openwifi-ready boards.

!!! note "ZedBoard-class boards (Zynq-7020) have tighter limits"
    Boards built on the smaller Zynq-7020 (ZedBoard, ADRV9364-Z7020, ZC702, `antsdr`, `sdrpi`, and the other boards listed in [Supported Boards](Supported-Boards.md#the-board-matrix)) have less FPGA memory, so a few features (notably IQ capture buffer length) have reduced limits. The relevant pages call this out.

## 2. Flash the SD card

1. Download the prebuilt openwifi image linked from the [openwifi README](https://github.com/open-sdr/openwifi#download-img-and-quick-start) and unzip it to a `.img` file.
2. Write it to the SD card with an imaging tool (GNOME Disks, Startup Disk Creator, win32diskimager) or with `dd`:

   ```bash
   # Find the correct sector count first:
   fdisk -l openwifi-xyz.img
   sudo dd bs=512 count=<sectors_from_fdisk> if=openwifi-xyz.img of=/dev/your_sdcard_dev
   ```

   Afterwards the card should show two partitions: `BOOT` and `rootfs`.

3. Configure the card for your board (do this on your PC before first boot):
    - Copy everything from `BOOT/openwifi/<board_name>/` into the root of the `BOOT` partition.
    - Delete `rootfs/root/kernel_modules` if it exists.
    - Delete `rootfs/etc/network/interfaces.new` if it exists (a common cause of "can't ssh to the board").

## 3. First boot and login

1. Insert the SD card, set the board's boot-mode jumpers/switches to SD boot, connect the antennas, and power on.
2. Give your PC's Ethernet interface the static IP `192.168.10.1` (netmask 255.255.255.0). The board boots with IP `192.168.10.122`.
3. Log in (password: `openwifi`):

   ```bash
   ssh root@192.168.10.122
   ```

   If ssh fails, connect the UART console to watch the boot, and see [Troubleshooting](Troubleshooting.md).

4. One-time setup on a fresh board:

   ```bash
   raspi-config --expand-rootfs   # only if your SD card is larger than 16 GB (reboot after)
   ./openwifi/setup_once.sh       # then reboot
   ```

## 4. Start the access point

On the board:

```bash
cd openwifi
./wgd.sh        # loads the FPGA image (if present) and the openwifi driver, creates NIC "sdr0"
./fosdem.sh     # starts hostapd (SSID "openwifi") plus a DHCP server and a demo webserver
```

Useful variants: `./wgd.sh 1` enables experimental A-MPDU aggregation (higher 11n throughput), and `./fosdem-11ag.sh` forces legacy 11a/g mode.

Now look for the **"openwifi"** SSID on your phone or laptop and connect. You should receive an IP in the `192.168.13.0/24` range. Browse to `192.168.13.1` to see the on-board demo page.

Two things to know:

- The default configuration uses **channel 44 (5 GHz)**. If your client device is 2.4 GHz-only, edit `hostapd-openwifi.conf` on the board (channel/band) and re-run `fosdem.sh`.
- The FPGA uses an **evaluation license** of the Xilinx Viterbi decoder, which halts after roughly two hours of operation. Symptoms: reception dies, and `./sdrctl dev sdr0 get reg rx 20` returns the same value forever. The fix is to reload the FPGA (see [dynamic reloading](Software-Development-Workflow.md#reloading-driver-and-fpga-without-rebooting)) or power-cycle the board.

The ADRV9361-Z7035 has very low TX power in the 5 GHz band, so keep devices close when using that board on 5 GHz.

## 5. Give clients internet access (optional)

The board has no internet uplink, so route client traffic through your PC.

On the PC, find the internet interface and the interface connected to the board:

```bash
ip route show default
ip -br address
```

The internet interface appears after `dev` in the default route. The board-facing interface has the address `192.168.10.1`. Set the example names below to match your PC, then run the setup once:

```bash
BOARD_NIC=eth0
INTERNET_NIC=wlp0s20f3

sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
sudo ip route replace 192.168.13.0/24 via 192.168.10.122 dev "$BOARD_NIC"
sudo iptables -I FORWARD 1 -i "$BOARD_NIC" -o "$INTERNET_NIC" -s 192.168.13.0/24 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -I FORWARD 1 -i "$INTERNET_NIC" -o "$BOARD_NIC" -d 192.168.13.0/24 -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.13.0/24 -o "$INTERNET_NIC" -j MASQUERADE
```

The two `FORWARD` rules allow client requests and their replies. `MASQUERADE` translates client addresses to the PC's internet-facing address.

From a connected Linux client, test each stage in order:

```bash
ping -c 3 192.168.13.1    # client to openwifi board
ping -c 3 192.168.10.1    # board forwarding to PC
ping -c 3 1.1.1.1         # PC forwarding and NAT
ping -c 3 example.com     # DNS
```

IP forwarding resets when the PC reboots. The route and firewall rules may also disappear when you reload the PC's network or firewall configuration. For a permanent setup, enable forwarding through `sysctl.d` and configure the route and rules through the PC's network and firewall managers.

## 6. What just happened?

The board is a small Linux computer. `wgd.sh` loaded the openwifi FPGA design and kernel driver, which registered a normal Linux Wi-Fi interface called **`sdr0`**. Everything after that (`hostapd`, DHCP, `iw`, `tcpdump`) is stock Linux behaving exactly as it would with a commercial Wi-Fi card. That is the central idea of openwifi, and the [Architecture Overview](Architecture.md) explains how it's achieved.

## Alternative: OpenWrt

Prefer a router-style experience with the LuCI web UI? Prebuilt OpenWrt images with openwifi baked in are available for most boards. Flash the image, boot, and an `openwrt-openwifi` SSID appears on 2.4 GHz channel 1 within about a minute. See the [OpenWrt build instructions](https://github.com/open-sdr/openwifi/blob/master/doc/img_build_instruction/openwrt/README.md) for the support matrix, usage examples, and how to build your own image.
