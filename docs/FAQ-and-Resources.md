# FAQ and Resources

## Frequently asked questions

### What hardware do you need, and how do you get it running?

Pick a board from [Supported Boards](Supported-Boards.md): the ZedBoard plus an FMCOMMS2/3 card is the classic reference, and several cheaper community boards work too. Then follow [Getting Started](Getting-Started.md) to flash the SD image, boot the board, and bring up the `sdr0` interface.

### Is openwifi a real Wi-Fi chip?

It's a full-stack Wi-Fi design that runs on FPGA-based SDR hardware, not (yet) a fabricated ASIC. Functionally the FPGA behaves like a Wi-Fi chip: it presents a standard Linux Wi-Fi interface and interoperates with commercial devices. The difference is that every layer is open and modifiable.

### Which 802.11 standards does it support?

802.11a/g and 802.11n (Wi-Fi 4) at 20 MHz in the open-source release. 802.11ax and other advanced features are commercial (see [openwifi.tech](https://openwifi.tech)). A feature-by-feature breakdown, including why there's no Wi-Fi 5, is on [Wi-Fi 4 & Wi-Fi 6 Features](Wi-Fi-4-and-Wi-Fi-6.md).

### Does it do MIMO or 40 MHz?

Not in the open-source release. openwifi's 11n implements 52 subcarriers, 5/6 coding, and 400 ns short guard interval, for a theoretical 72.2 Mbps single-stream. MIMO, 40 MHz bandwidth, and A-MSDU are **not** supported. A-MPDU aggregation is available experimentally (`./wgd.sh 1`). For context, full 11n (4×4 MIMO + 40 MHz) tops out at 600 Mbps, but openwifi targets the single-stream 20 MHz subset.

### Why won't a 2.4 GHz phone connect when 5 GHz works?

openwifi is OFDM-only and not backward-compatible with 802.11b, which makes 2.4 GHz association fail. Suppress 11b rates on both ends, or use 5 GHz. Full details: [Operating Modes → About 802.11b](Operating-Modes.md#about-80211b).

### Can it work outside normal Wi-Fi frequencies?

Yes. The AD9361 tunes 70 MHz–6 GHz. Bring the system up on the nearest legal channel, lock the frequency so the driver stops re-tuning it, then override the RF frequency. See [sdrctl → arbitrary tuning](sdrctl-and-Runtime-Control.md#frequency-restrict-and-arbitrary-tuning). You can also run narrower bandwidths (2 MHz for sub-GHz 802.11ah-style, 10 MHz for 802.11p vehicular). Mind your local spectrum regulations.

### The receiver stops working after about two hours. Broken?

No. That's the Xilinx Viterbi decoder evaluation license halting. Reload the FPGA or power-cycle. See [Troubleshooting](Troubleshooting.md#reception-dies-after-2-hours).

### Do you need a paid Vivado license?

Only for some boards. Boards with the Zynq-7020 FPGA (ZedBoard, ADRV9364-Z7020, ZC702, `antsdr`, `sdrpi`, and the [community 7020 boards](Supported-Boards.md#the-community-microphase-hexsdr-boards-in-detail)) build under the free Vivado tier. ZC706, ZCU102, ADRV9361-Z7035, and RFSoC4x2 need a license to rebuild the FPGA. Either way, the prebuilt images need no license to *run*.

### Can you try it without any hardware?

Yes. The imec [w-iLab.t testbed](https://doc.ilabt.imec.be/ilabt/wilab/tutorials/openwifi.html) offers remote access to openwifi boards (and supports JTAG boot instead of SD card).

### Is an openwifi ASIC planned (for example on SkyWater sky130)?

It's frequently requested, and the team is supportive but not actively working on it. The current focus is maturing the FPGA IP to match commercial chips. A Wi-Fi chip is more complex than it looks, and cheap only because of enormous production volume.

Anyone doing a serious ASIC analysis would need to port many vendor IP cores (FFT, Viterbi, FIFO, RAM/ROM, FIR, AXI DMA/lite, dividers, multipliers) plus handle two hard parts: the AD9361 RF interface (the AD9361 is an expensive 70 MHz–6 GHz SDR front end, not a cheap dedicated Wi-Fi radio) and the AXI-bus coupling to the processor (great for latency, but platform-specific). The team welcomes a larger organization leading such an effort. Full reasoning: the [ASIC considerations note](https://github.com/open-sdr/openwifi/blob/master/doc/asic/skywater-130-pdk-and-asic-considerations.md).

### Windows for development?
