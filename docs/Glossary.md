# Glossary

openwifi sits at the intersection of Wi-Fi (802.11), FPGA/SoC design, and the Linux wireless stack, so the documentation is dense with acronyms from all three worlds. This page defines the terms used across the wiki. Use your browser's search, or the site search, to jump to a term.

A-MPDU
:   Aggregated MAC Protocol Data Unit. An 802.11n frame-aggregation method that packs several MPDUs (each with its own header/CRC) into one transmission, so a single error costs only one retransmission. openwifi supports this experimentally (`./wgd.sh 1`). See [Architecture](Architecture.md#what-openwifi-implements-of-80211agn).

A-MSDU
:   Aggregated MAC Service Data Unit. The other 802.11n aggregation method, more efficient on the wire, but one bit error invalidates the whole aggregate. **Not** supported by openwifi.

AD9361
:   The Analog Devices RF transceiver chip openwifi uses as its radio front end. A general-purpose SDR transceiver tunable from 70 MHz to 6 GHz (the AD9364 is the single-channel variant). Driven by the standard Linux IIO driver.

ADC / DAC
:   Analog-to-Digital / Digital-to-Analog Converter. The AD9361's data converters between the analog RF signal and the FPGA's digital IQ samples. `rx_intf` handles the ADC side, `tx_intf` the DAC side.

ADI
:   Analog Devices, Inc. Vendor of the AD9361 and of the [HDL reference design](https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/hdl) that openwifi's FPGA design is built on top of.

AGC
:   Automatic Gain Control. The AD9361 circuit that adjusts receive gain to keep the signal in range. openwifi can capture the AGC gain/lock state per sample during [IQ capture](Research-Features.md#iq-capture).

AIFS
:   Arbitration Interframe Space: the per-access-category idle time a station waits before backoff in the QoS (EDCA) variant of CSMA/CA. Set per TX queue by Linux through the `conf_tx` callback. See [Architecture](Architecture.md#how-the-driver-talks-to-linux-the-mac80211-api).

ATF (BL31)
:   ARM Trusted Firmware. On 64-bit ZynqMP boards (ZCU102) the "BL31" secure-monitor stage is required in the boot chain. It is not needed on 32-bit Zynq-7000 boards.

AXI
:   Advanced eXtensible Interface, the ARM on-chip bus. openwifi's FPGA cores expose control registers over **AXI4-Lite** and move sample data over **AXI-Stream** (DMA). The tight AXI coupling to the processor is what gives openwifi low latency but makes the design platform-specific.

Baseband
:   The signal at (or near) zero frequency, before RF up-conversion. openwifi's Wi-Fi baseband runs at 20 Msps inside the FPGA, derived from the AD9361's 40 Msps IQ stream.

BRAM
:   Block RAM: the FPGA's on-chip memory blocks. openwifi uses BRAM for the TX packet buffer and the side-channel capture FIFO. Small (Zynq-7020) FPGAs have less of it, which is why capture buffers are capped shorter there (the `SIDE_CH_LESS_BRAM` build). See [Supported Boards](Supported-Boards.md).

BSSID
:   Basic Service Set Identifier: the MAC address identifying a Wi-Fi network (the AP's address in infrastructure mode). The FPGA can filter received frames by BSSID.

CCA
:   Clear Channel Assessment. The "is the channel busy?" check in CSMA/CA. openwifi's threshold is configurable (or defeatable) via `sdrctl` (see also **LBT**, below).

CDD
:   Cyclic Delay Diversity: transmitting a 1-sample-delayed copy of the signal on a second antenna to add artificial multipath and improve robustness. openwifi supports a simple CDD via `tx_intf` register 16.

cfg80211 / mac80211
:   The two layers of the Linux kernel wireless stack. `cfg80211` is the configuration API, and `mac80211` is the SoftMAC layer that openwifi's driver plugs into. See [Architecture](Architecture.md#how-the-driver-talks-to-linux-the-mac80211-api).

CSI
:   Channel State Information: the per-subcarrier channel response the receiver estimates. openwifi can stream CSI (plus frequency offset and equalizer output) to a PC. The project also puns it as "Chip State Information." See [Research Features](Research-Features.md#csi-channel-state-information).

CSMA/CA
:   Carrier-Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance: the 802.11 channel-access mechanism (the DCF). openwifi implements it in the FPGA's `xpu` core so it can meet microsecond timing.

CW
:   Contention Window. The range from which CSMA/CA picks a random backoff. Per-queue CWmin/CWmax are configurable via `sdrctl`.

DCF
:   Distributed Coordination Function: the standard's name for the CSMA/CA-based channel-access method. Implemented in `csma_ca.v` inside `xpu`.

DCXO
:   Digitally controlled crystal oscillator: the AD9361's tunable reference crystal. A board overlay sets its coarse/fine tuning (`adi,dcxo-coarse-and-fine-tune`) to trim the frequency. See [Boot, Kernel & Device Tree](Boot-Kernel-Device-Tree.md#what-a-board-overlay-adds).

Device tree (DTB / DTS / DTSO)
:   The data structure that describes to Linux what hardware is present and at which addresses/interrupts. openwifi builds a board's `devicetree.dtb` by layering overlays (`.dtso`) onto a stock board tree. Porting a board is largely a device-tree exercise.

DIFS
:   DCF Interframe Space: the idle time a station waits before starting contention. One of the CSMA timing parameters `xpu` implements (and that can be disabled for experiments).

DMA
:   Direct Memory Access. Moves packets and captured samples between the FPGA and the processor's memory without CPU copying. openwifi uses a TX descriptor ring and an RX cyclic buffer.

EIFS
:   Extended Interframe Space: a longer wait used after a reception error. Configurable/defeatable in `xpu`.

ERP
:   Extended Rate PHY: the 802.11g amendment that brought OFDM to 2.4 GHz. "ERP short-slot" (the shorter 9 µs slot time) is one of the CSMA parameters `xpu` register 4 carries.

EVM
:   Error Vector Magnitude: a measure of modulation accuracy (lower is better). openwifi reaches roughly −38 dB EVM in its best configuration.

FCS
:   Frame Check Sequence: the CRC appended to an 802.11 frame. The FPGA reports FCS pass/fail per received packet, and monitor mode passes even bad-FCS frames up.

FDD
:   Frequency Division Duplex. openwifi drives the AD9361 in FDD mode but with identical TX and RX frequencies, gating the TX chain on/off around each packet to avoid self-interference.

FEC
:   Forward Error Correction: the convolutional coding (with puncturing) used by 802.11 OFDM, decoded on receive by a Viterbi decoder.

FFT / IFFT
:   (Inverse) Fast Fourier Transform: the core OFDM operation. `openofdm_tx` uses an IFFT to build the time-domain signal from the subcarriers, and the receiver uses an FFT to recover them.

FMC
:   FPGA Mezzanine Card: a standard connector/daughter-card form factor. The AD9361-carrying FMCOMMS2/3/4 cards are FMC modules that plug into the Xilinx dev boards.

FMCOMMS2/3/4
:   Analog Devices FMC daughter-cards carrying the AD9361, used with Xilinx dev boards (ZC706, ZedBoard, ZC702, ZCU102) in several supported openwifi platforms.

FPGA
:   Field-Programmable Gate Array: the reconfigurable logic fabric (inside the Zynq SoC) where openwifi's PHY and real-time MAC live.

FRU
:   Field-Replaceable Unit: here, the identification data in an FMCOMMS board's EEPROM. A wrong or empty FRU EEPROM can crash the host (notably ZCU102). Reprogram it with `fru_tools`. See [Troubleshooting](Troubleshooting.md#fmcomms-board-causes-a-linux-crash-badempty-eeprom).

FSBL
:   First Stage Boot Loader. The initial boot stage built from the hardware description. On some boards it (rather than U-Boot SPL) is needed to initialize DDR correctly.

FSM
:   Finite State Machine: sequential logic that steps through a fixed set of states, the standard way control logic is built in an FPGA. The wiki uses the term for blocks like the side channel's capture FSM (what its register 0 bit 2 resets) and the CSMA/CA logic in `xpu`. See [side_ch_ctl](side_ch_ctl-and-the-Side-Channel.md#register-reference).

Full duplex
:   Here, the ability to receive while transmitting. openwifi's receiver can hear its own transmission, which enables the [CSI radar](Research-Features.md#csi-radar-full-duplex-self-sensing) and [loopback](Research-Features.md#self-loopback-testing) features.

GEM
:   Gigabit Ethernet MAC: the Zynq PS-side Ethernet controller. Some boards (ANTSDR-E200 / E310 v2) move Ethernet to the PL side instead, to free the processor at high sample rates. See [Supported Boards](Supported-Boards.md#antsdr-e200-microphase).

Guard interval (GI)
:   The cyclic-prefix gap between OFDM symbols that absorbs multipath. 802.11n adds a **short GI** (400 ns vs 800 ns) for higher throughput, and openwifi supports it.

HLS
:   High-Level Synthesis: generating FPGA logic from C++ (via Vitis HLS). openwifi's channel-estimation and equalizer stages are available as HLS modules. See [FPGA Development](FPGA-Development.md#high-level-synthesis-hls-modules).

hostapd
:   The standard Linux user-space daemon that turns a Wi-Fi interface into an access point. openwifi runs stock `hostapd` over `sdr0`. See [hostapd and wpa_supplicant](hostapd-and-wpa_supplicant.md).

HT
:   High Throughput: the 802.11n feature set. Related terms: **HT-SIG** (the 11n signal field), **STF/LTF** (short/long training fields in the preamble).

IBSS
:   Independent Basic Service Set: 802.11 ad-hoc mode, where stations talk peer-to-peer without an AP. See [Operating Modes](Operating-Modes.md#ad-hoc-ibss).

IIO
:   Industrial I/O: the Linux subsystem (and driver) used to control the AD9361 (gains, sample rate, LO frequency) via sysfs.

ILA
:   Integrated Logic Analyzer: a Xilinx debug core inserted into the FPGA to observe internal signals in real time. openwifi can build with ILA cores enabled. See [FPGA Development](FPGA-Development.md#debugging-on-hardware).

IQ samples
:   In-phase/Quadrature samples: the complex representation of a baseband signal. openwifi can capture raw IQ via the side channel.

Kuiper (ADI Kuiper)
:   Analog Devices' Debian/Ubuntu-based Linux distribution for its SDR platforms, and the classic openwifi runtime environment (the alternative is OpenWrt). See [Building SD Images](Building-SD-Images.md).

LBT
:   Listen Before Talk: the regulatory term for carrier sensing before transmitting. In openwifi the LBT/CCA threshold is a `sdrctl`-tunable register.

LO
:   Local Oscillator: the mixing frequency in the RF chain. openwifi switches the TX LO on just before a packet and off after, so it doesn't interfere with reception.

LuCI
:   The web configuration UI of OpenWrt. openwifi's OpenWrt images expose the radio through LuCI's Network → Wireless page. See [Building SD Images](Building-SD-Images.md#openwrt).

MAC (low / upper)
:   Medium Access Control. openwifi splits it: the **upper MAC** (association, management) runs in Linux `mac80211`, and the **low MAC** (real-time CSMA/CA, ACK, timers) runs in the FPGA `xpu` core.

MCS
:   Modulation and Coding Scheme: an index selecting modulation + code rate (and thus data rate). openwifi supports MCS 0–7 (single stream).

MIMO
:   Multiple-Input Multiple-Output: using multiple spatial streams for higher throughput. **Not** supported in the open-source release.

minstrel_ht
:   The default Linux `mac80211` rate-control algorithm, which picks the TX rate/MCS automatically. openwifi lets you override it and pin a fixed rate via `sdrctl`. See [sdrctl](sdrctl-and-Runtime-Control.md#tx-rate-mcs-override).

Monitor mode
:   A receive mode that captures every frame, including control frames and bad-FCS frames. Prerequisite for packet injection and most research captures.

NAV
:   Network Allocation Vector: the virtual carrier-sense timer set by RTS/CTS duration fields. Implemented (and defeatable) in `xpu`.

nl80211 / testmode
:   The netlink interface between user space and `cfg80211`. openwifi's `sdrctl` reaches the driver through the `nl80211` **testmode** command path.

OFDM
:   Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing: the multi-subcarrier modulation used by 802.11a/g/n. openwifi's PHY is OFDM-only (hence no 802.11b compatibility).

OFDMA
:   Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access: the 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) feature that assigns subcarrier groups to different users at once. Not in the open-source release, but explored in openwifi research. See [Wi-Fi 4 & Wi-Fi 6 Features](Wi-Fi-4-and-Wi-Fi-6.md#wi-fi-6-80211ax).

openofdm
:   The open-source 802.11 OFDM receiver project openwifi's `openofdm_rx` core is based on (openwifi's fork lives on the `dot11zynq` branch).

OpenWrt
:   The router-focused embedded Linux distribution. openwifi ships as an OpenWrt kernel module, giving a router-style image with the LuCI web UI. See [Building SD Images](Building-SD-Images.md#openwrt).

PER
:   Packet Error Rate: the fraction of packets lost or received in error. `rx_stat_show.sh` computes it given how many packets the peer sent. See [sdrctl](sdrctl-and-Runtime-Control.md#statistics-via-sysfs).

PHY
:   The physical layer: modulation, coding, and RF. In openwifi the PHY is the `openofdm_tx`/`openofdm_rx` cores plus the AD9361.

PL / PS
:   Programmable Logic / Processing System: the two halves of a Xilinx Zynq SoC. The FPGA fabric is the PL, and the ARM cores are the PS. Some boards move Ethernet to the PL side for bandwidth.

PMUFW
:   Platform Management Unit Firmware: a ZynqMP-specific boot component (ZCU102) built alongside the FSBL and ATF.

PPS
:   Pulse Per Second: a once-a-second timing signal (typically from GPS) for precise clock alignment. Boards like the E310 v2 accept an external 10 MHz / PPS reference. See [Supported Boards](Supported-Boards.md#antsdr-e310-v2-microphase).

Preamble
:   The known symbols at the start of an 802.11 packet used for detection, synchronization, and channel estimation (the **STF** and **LTF** training fields).

RSSI
:   Received Signal Strength Indicator: an estimate of received power. openwifi reports a per-packet RSSI (calibrated to dBm) and can capture it during IQ capture.

RTS/CTS
:   Request To Send / Clear To Send: the 802.11 handshake that reserves the channel (via the NAV) before a data frame, mitigating hidden-node collisions. openwifi's `xpu` generates and honors it in hardware, gated by the packet-length threshold (`set_rts_threshold`).

RU (Resource Unit)
:   A group of OFDMA subcarriers (26, 52, 106, or 242 tones in a 20 MHz channel) assigned to one station, so several stations can share a single 802.11ax transmission. Not in the open-source release. See [Wi-Fi 4 & Wi-Fi 6 Features](Wi-Fi-4-and-Wi-Fi-6.md#a-short-80211-primer).

SDR
:   Software-Defined Radio: a radio whose signal processing is done in software/logic rather than fixed hardware. openwifi is a full-stack Wi-Fi design on SDR hardware.

sdr0
:   The network-interface name the openwifi driver creates for the board's Wi-Fi. Standard Linux tools (`iw`, `tcpdump`, `hostapd`, `wpa_supplicant`) all operate on `sdr0`. See [Operating Modes](Operating-Modes.md).

Side channel (`side_ch`)
:   openwifi's FPGA capture engine: it taps the receiver's IQ and the demodulator's internal results (CSI, equalizer) and DMAs them to the host, independent of the normal packet path. See [FPGA IP Cores](FPGA-IP-Cores.md#side_ch-the-csi-iq-capture-side-channel).

SIFS
:   Short Interframe Space: the brief gap before an ACK, 10 µs in 2.4 GHz (802.11g) and 16 µs in 5 GHz (802.11a). Meeting SIFS timing is why the low MAC has to be in hardware.

SoC
:   System on Chip. openwifi runs on Xilinx Zynq / Zynq UltraScale+ SoCs, which combine ARM cores (PS) with FPGA fabric (PL).

SODIMM
:   Small Outline DIMM: the pluggable DRAM module used on some boards (for example the ZCU102). Certain modules fail with the U-Boot SPL DDR bring-up. See [Troubleshooting](Troubleshooting.md#no-uart-output-on-zcu102-under-openwrt).

SoftMAC
:   A Wi-Fi design where the upper MAC runs in host software (Linux `mac80211`) rather than on the chip. openwifi is a SoftMAC design, which is why standard Linux tools work over `sdr0`.

SoM
:   System on Module: a small board carrying the SoC, RAM, and support circuitry, mounted on a larger carrier. The ADRV9364-Z7020 and ADRV9361-Z7035 are SoMs on the ADRV1CRR carrier.

SPI
:   Serial Peripheral Interface. openwifi drives the AD9361's TX chain in real time over an FPGA-generated SPI link (`spi.v` in `xpu`) for fast TX/RX turnaround.

SPL
:   Secondary Program Loader: U-Boot's first-stage loader. On some 64-bit boards it mis-configures certain DDR modules, so the Xilinx FSBL is used instead. See [Troubleshooting](Troubleshooting.md#no-uart-output-on-zcu102-under-openwrt).

STA
:   Station: the 802.11 standard's term for any device on the link. A client and an access point are both STAs, but "STA" is often used specifically for the non-AP client. openwifi runs as either, over `sdr0`. See [Operating Modes](Operating-Modes.md).

sysfs
:   The Linux virtual filesystem exposing kernel/driver variables as files. openwifi exposes its statistics and some controls through sysfs. See [sdrctl](sdrctl-and-Runtime-Control.md#statistics-via-sysfs).

TSF
:   Timing Synchronization Function: the 802.11 64-bit hardware timer. openwifi timestamps every received packet and every captured sample with the TSF, which is how CSI/IQ captures line up with specific packets.

TSN
:   Time-Sensitive Networking: deterministic, scheduled networking. openwifi's MAC-address-based [time slicing](sdrctl-and-Runtime-Control.md#time-slicing-network-slicing) supports TSN-style experiments.

UART
:   Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter: the serial console. A USB-UART cable is the essential tool for watching boot messages when networking won't come up. See [Troubleshooting](Troubleshooting.md#boot-and-networking).

U-Boot
:   The bootloader that loads the Linux kernel on the board. Part of `BOOT.BIN` alongside the FSBL and FPGA bitstream.

UHD
:   USRP Hardware Driver: Ettus/NI's SDR driver framework. Some MicroPhase boards can run as UHD devices via a separate project. That is unrelated to openwifi's Wi-Fi operation, but it explains their PL-side Ethernet design.

VCXO
:   Voltage-Controlled Crystal Oscillator: a tunable reference clock. Some boards (E310 v2, SDRPi) add one, with an external reference, for a more stable clock (useful for time-sync/TSN).

VDMA
:   Video DMA: a Xilinx AXI DMA variant for video streams. openwifi doesn't use it, but one kernel patch comments out a VDMA/AXI-HDMI call that otherwise breaks the build once Xilinx AXI DMA is enabled. See [Boot, Kernel & Device Tree](Boot-Kernel-Device-Tree.md#the-kernel-patches).

Viterbi decoder
:   The algorithm/IP that decodes the convolutional FEC on receive. openwifi uses a Xilinx Viterbi decoder IP, whose **evaluation license** is why a running board's receiver halts after ~2 hours. See [Troubleshooting](Troubleshooting.md#reception-dies-after-2-hours).

Vivado / Vitis
:   Xilinx's FPGA design tools. openwifi's FPGA build targets **Vivado 2022.2 with Vitis**. Some boards need a paid Vivado license to rebuild the FPGA, but the prebuilt images need none.

wpa_supplicant
:   The standard Linux user-space client for joining Wi-Fi networks. openwifi runs stock `wpa_supplicant` over `sdr0` in client mode. See [hostapd and wpa_supplicant](hostapd-and-wpa_supplicant.md).

`wgd.sh`
:   The on-board bring-up script that loads the FPGA image and the openwifi driver and brings up the `sdr0` interface. See [Software Development Workflow](Software-Development-Workflow.md).

`xpu`
:   openwifi's real-time MAC core (its largest FPGA IP block): CSMA/CA, TSF timer, hardware ACK generation/reception, packet filtering, RSSI/CCA, and TX-queue gating. See [FPGA IP Cores](FPGA-IP-Cores.md#xpu-the-real-time-mac).

Zynq / Zynq UltraScale+ (MPSoC)
:   Xilinx SoC families. **Zynq-7000** is 32-bit (most openwifi boards). **Zynq UltraScale+ / MPSoC** is 64-bit (ZCU102), with a different boot chain.
