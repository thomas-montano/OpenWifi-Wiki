# Application Notes

openwifi ships a set of **application notes** in [`openwifi/doc/app_notes/`](https://github.com/open-sdr/openwifi/blob/master/doc/app_notes/README.md): short, task-focused write-ups for specific scenarios and modes. Their material is spread across the thematic wiki pages ([Operating Modes](Operating-Modes.md), [Research Features](Research-Features.md), [sdrctl](sdrctl-and-Runtime-Control.md), and so on), and this page indexes every note in one place.

These notes assume a board that already boots and runs `wgd.sh`. If you are not there yet, start with [Getting Started](Getting-Started.md).

Each entry below expands to a short summary and the note's key figures. Use **Read more** to jump to the full section on that topic, or **Original note** to open the app note on GitHub.

## Getting on the air: two-SDR links

??? note "Communication between two SDR boards: AP and client mode"
    Step-by-step for an access-point + client link between two openwifi boards using the standard, unmodified `hostapd` and `wpa_supplicant`. Covers confirming beacon transmission via `/proc/interrupts`, associating the client, and getting an IP over the link.

??? note "Communication between two SDR boards: ad-hoc mode"
    Bring two boards into the same 802.11 ad-hoc (IBSS) cell with `sdr-ad-hoc-up.sh`, confirm both nodes converge on the same Cell ID, and ping across. Includes the antenna-isolation and 5 GHz TX-power caveats.

## CSI and sensing

??? note "From CSI (Channel State Information) to CSI (Chip State Information)"
    Per-packet CSI (timestamp, frequency offset, channel response, and equalizer output) streamed to a PC through the FPGA side channel. Shows the data path, the 64-bit packet format, how to filter captures by MAC address, and the display scripts.

??? note "WiFi CSI radar via self CSI capturing"
    Full-duplex "Wi-Fi radar": with a TX and an RX antenna, the CSI of openwifi's own transmitted signal reflects changes in the environment. Enable reception of the board's own signal (via `sdrctl`, register `xpu 1`), inject a stream of packets to sound the channel, and watch the CSI waterfall change as people or objects move.

??? note "CSI fuzzer"
    Inject a controlled *artificial* channel response at the transmitter so an eavesdropper's CSI-based sensing is corrupted while normal communication continues. Includes commands to sweep and apply fuzzer parameters and to watch the effect via self-monitoring.

## IQ capture

??? note "Capture IQ sample, AGC gain, RSSI with many trigger conditions"
    Capture raw baseband IQ plus the AD9361 AGC gain/lock status and RSSI, windowed around any of 30+ trigger conditions. Also compares the FPGA's frequency-offset estimate against a Python calculation.

??? note "ACK timing verification by IQ capture"
    Trigger IQ capture on the ACK-send event to directly measure the Rx-ACK-GAP and Tx-ACK-GAP (the gap between the end of reception, or transmission, of a packet and the ACK leaving the board) against the ~16 µs SIFS across MCS and packet lengths.

??? note "Capture dual-antenna TX/RX IQ (collision capture and TX IQ)"
    Capture IQ from a second *monitoring* antenna coherently alongside the main antenna. Placed near a peer node, the monitoring antenna catches collisions (moments when both link ends transmit at once) via a dedicated collision trigger. The note also includes two quick starts for capturing the board's own TX IQ from inside the FPGA, one fired by a transmit-start trigger and one free-running.

??? note "Wi-Fi packet, CSI and IQ self-loopback test"
    Verify the TX→RX path end-to-end at the packet, CSI, and IQ level, either over the air (antennas close together) or entirely inside the FPGA. The FPGA-internal loopback provides a distortion-free "golden" reference.

## Injection and fuzzing

??? note "802.11 packet injection and fuzzing"
    Build and use the `inject_80211` tool to craft and transmit arbitrary 802.11 frames in monitor mode, control whether the FPGA generates ACKs, and run link-performance sweeps that are analyzed offline with `analyze_80211`.

??? note "owfuzz: a Wi-Fi protocol fuzzing tool (external)"
    A third-party 802.11 protocol fuzzer built on openwifi, with a published list of discovered vulnerabilities. Hosted outside the openwifi repos.

## Standards background

??? note "IEEE 802.11n (Wi-Fi 4)"
    Background on the five 802.11n PHY improvements (more subcarriers, a higher FEC code rate (5/6), short guard interval, MIMO, 40 MHz) and frame aggregation, with a throughput derivation, and which parts openwifi implements: 52 subcarriers, 5/6 FEC, short GI, and experimental A-MPDU.

## Counters and statistics

??? note "Access counter/statistics in FPGA"
    Read FPGA-level event counters directly: the `openofdm_rx` watchdog counters (abnormal-signal events) and the side-channel PHY RX/TX event counters (preamble detected, TX start/done, good-FCS frames addressed to the board, and more), all via register reads.

??? note "Access counter/statistics in driver"
    Enable, read, filter, and clear driver-level TX/RX statistics exposed through sysfs: per-packet success/fail counts, realtime MCS, AGC gain, per-peer filtering, and PER calculation.

## Runtime control and dev workflow

??? note "Frequent tricks: Gain / Att / Frequency / CCA / LBT / CSMA / CW / Sensitivity"
    A cookbook of everyday runtime overrides: TX power and attenuation, RX gain, CCA/LBT threshold, NAV/DIFS/EIFS/CW, ACK and retransmission control, antenna selection, frequency restriction and arbitrary tuning, TX rate, and arbitrary IQ transmission.

??? note "Driver and FPGA dynamic reloading"
    Hot-reload the driver and/or FPGA bitstream on a running board with `wgd.sh`: no reboot, no power cycle, and keep several driver/FPGA variants side by side for quick switching.

## FPGA

??? note "Build FPGA with High-Level Synthesis modules"
    Build the receiver's channel-estimation (`ch_gain_cal`) and equalizer (`equalizer`) stages from C++ via Vitis HLS instead of hand-written Verilog, which can speed up algorithm development. Based on an FCCM 2023 poster.

## Remote access

??? note "Use openwifi on the w-iLab.t testbed remotely (external)"
    No hardware? The imec w-iLab.t testbed offers remote access to openwifi-ready boards, including JTAG boot instead of SD-card boot. Hosted on the imec documentation site.
